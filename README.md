## Hi 👋 I'm Alex and I work at the intersection of biology and AI 

I completed my PhD in using ML for protein design in 2017 📖 and worked for 6 years at Ginkgo Bioworks 🌱, where I designed millions of proteins across hundreds of functional classes with AI 🤖, designed more synthetic DNA than anyone on Earth 🧬, and focused on protein therapeutics designed with generative ML ☕️. In 2024, I'm looking for opportunities contributing to a team working on ML for biology. Please feel free to send me an email! 📫
