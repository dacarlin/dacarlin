## Hi 👋 I'm Alex and I work at the intersection of biology and AI 

- PhD work advancing ML for protein design in 2017 📖
- 6 years at Ginkgo Bioworks 🌱 where I designed millions of proteins with AI 🤖
- I've designed more synthetic DNA than anyone on Earth 🧬 
- I'm interested in protein therapeutic design with generative ML ☕️

In 2024, I'm looking for opportunities contributing to a team working on ML for biology. Please feel free to send me an email! 📫
